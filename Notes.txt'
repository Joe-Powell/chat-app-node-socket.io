socket.io docs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io      https://socket.io/docs/v4/

the flow:
1. In server.js make a connection with express after the installs
2. In server ,make connection io.on('connection', socket => { } )
3. 



in the server:
socket.emit - goes to the individual user,
io.emit - emits to everybody,
socket.on - listens and then emits in it's second paremeter

in main.js:
const socket = io();
socket.on('message', message => {}) - listens for an emitter, and its second paremeter
is a function that spits out the message sent in from the server, use dom manipulation from there.
To send a message to the server from the front-end then back to client:
Add an event listener on submit, catch the form value in a variable,
then socket.emit('emitterNameInServer', messageToSend) \
in the server then it will catch it and then send it back as io.emit
socket.on('emitterNameInServer', (msg) => { io.emit('message', msg) })
